**Beresheet - In the Beginning** **-** **בְּרֵאשִׁית**

As the Book of Genesis starts so I start my Blog.  The intent behind the title is non-pretentious, but rather a  hommage to my people and to Israel's ill-fated Lunar Lander Beresheet.  Although, if the blog emits more than a few entries, for me it will be a feat of Biblical proportions. 

The main purpose is to capture my thoughts about stuff that matters to me and other musings.  As well:

* to experiment with a static site generator called [hugo](https://gohugo.io)
* a markdown editor called [typora](https://typora.io); and
* the workflow for managing a static website.

Here we go...
